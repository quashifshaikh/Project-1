        <h2>Controversial Politician of Palestine</h2>
        <p>
          Yasser Arafat was a Palestinian political leader who was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1929¹. He was the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1969 to 2004 and President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) from 1994 to 2004¹². Arafat was a controversial figure who was seen by some as a freedom fighter and by others as a terrorist¹. He was a founding member of the Fatah political party, which he led from 1959 until 2004¹. 

Arafat was born to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where he spent most of his youth and studied at the University of King Fuad I¹. While a student, he embraced Arab nationalist and anti-Zionist ideas¹. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War¹. Following the defeat of Arab forces, Arafat returned to Cairo and served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956¹. In the latter part of the 1950s, Arafat co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organization which sought Israel's replacement with a Palestinian state¹. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets¹. 

In the latter part of the 1960s, Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC)¹. Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon¹. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in the organization becoming a major target of Israeli invasions during the 1978 South Lebanon conflict and 1982 Lebanon War¹. From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based himself in Tunisia, and began to shift his approach from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation¹. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict¹. In 1994, he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories¹. 

Arafat was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his role in the Oslo Accords, which established a framework for peace between Israel and Palestine¹². However, his legacy is still debated, and opinions on his actions and leadership are divided¹.
